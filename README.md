_Some even say that we inspired the games of the 2020s, that is, games such as Tall Man Run:_

## Functions
### 1. Using a modern Java GUI
Math Prodigy is coded entirely in Java, using Java Swing as the foundation for the game's GUI. Being coded in Java ensures that the code is mostly robust, and that it can run without any major memory or compilation problems. Java Swing allows for an interactive and usable UI experience.

### 2. Creating/Saving accounts
Math Prodigy uses Java file I/O to create as many accounts as you would like! Each account is created, containing the total amount of coins available in the account, as well as all available skins. When an account is created, it is stored within game files, ready to be accesssed by our game whenever it is running. We save all data at all points in time!

Furthermore, there is also a Remember Me function, in case you forget your username to an account. This box may be unticked at all times. 

### 3. Playing different gamemodes
Math Prodigy offers core gameplay, characterized by quick-thinking math problems. This gameplay is offered in an easy and hard mode, which the user may choose. Easy mode offers relaxed gameplay, which could go on forever. This is ideal for users wanting to relax while still using some of their brain. Hard mode starts off slow, but picks up pace quickly. It is a race against time, and offers users a challenging but doable experience. Regardless of the difficulty, Math Prodigy randomly generates an objective to complete, and reaching this objective gives a large amount of coins. Coins may also be obtained through regular play.

### 4. Purchasing and using skins in the shop
Math Prodigy stores the coins gained from each game in the users account, and the user may then use their coins to purchase skins in the shop. The skins offered include Spongebob, Peppa Pig, amongst many others. By playing more, it is an end goal to collect every skin in the game. These skins offer no competitive advantage, and are primarily just for aesthetic appeal.
